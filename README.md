### Description:

>parallax (n.)
>"apparent displacement of an object observed, due to an actual displacement of the observer," 1570s, from French parallaxe (mid-16c.),
>from Greek parallaxis "change, alteration, inclination of two lines meeting at an angle," from parallassein "to alter, make things alternate,"
>from para- (see para- (1)) + allassein "to change," from allos "other" (from PIE root *al- "beyond"). Related: Parallactic.
>
>Etymonline

*This is a simple project that I did to try and experiment with something that fascinated me--using parallax to create the appearance of interaction in a three dimensional environment (think x, y, z axis).*

The parallax effect assigns x, y, and z values to separate graphic elements and then calculates actions and movement in response to the movement of the mouse or to the tilt of the tablet if you are on a tablet or phone with an accelerometer.  

I used the parallax.js library from [Matthew Wagerfield](http://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/) for the javascript. Therefore I cannot take credit for the logic that controls the motion.

### THIS PROJECT DEMONSTRATES:

ðŸ†• Ability to teach myself interests outside of formal instruction.

ðŸ†• Integration of Photoshop layers and images in wireframing.

ðŸ†• Create a custom logo in Photoshop.

ðŸ†• Created the custom CSS using CSS3.

ðŸ†• Integration of JavaScript libraries.

ðŸ†• Use of HTML5.

ðŸ†• Accomplish a goal I didn't think I'd be able to do when I began the course.

ðŸ†• All art assets created by myself in Photoshop.

### CHALLENGES I OVERCAME...

* This was my first time using a third-party library

* Learning how to read documentation and experiment within the parameters of another person's code base

### MY OWN PERSONAL CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDED 

- [X] The third party library is obviously not mine, but all artwork and other work is my own.

### ATTRIBUTIONS

All artwork is my own
