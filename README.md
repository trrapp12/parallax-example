<sub>*This is a simple project that I did to try and experiment with something that fascinated me--using parallax to create the appearance of interaction in a three dimensional environment (think x, y, z axis).*</sub>

### Description:
---

The parallax effect assigns x, y, and z values to separate graphic elements and then calculates actions and movement in response to the movement of the mouse or to the tilt of the tablet if you are on a tablet or phone with an accelerometer.  

I used the parallax.js library from [Matthew Wagerfield](http://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/) for the javascript. Therefore I cannot take credit for the logic that controls the motion.  

### Project demonstrates the following:
---

- [x] **User Story #1**: I can see a title with id="title" in H1 sized text.

- [x] **User Story #2**: I can see a short explanation with id="description" in P sized text.

- [x] **User Story #3**: I can see a form with id="survey-form".

- [x] **User Story #4**: Inside the form element, I am required to enter my name in a field with id="name".

- [x] **User Story #5**: Inside the form element, I am required to enter an email in a field with id="email".

- [x] **User Story #6**: If I enter an email that is not formatted correctly, I will see an HTML5 validation error.

- [x] **User Story #7**: Inside the form, I can enter a number in a field with id="number".

- [x] **User Story #8**: If I enter non-numbers in the number input, I will see an HTML5 validation error.

- [x] **User Story #9**: If I enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, I will see an HTML5 validation error.

- [x] **User Story #10**: For the name, email, and number input fields inside the form I can see corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label".

- [x] **User Story #11**: For the name, email, and number input fields, I can see placeholder text that gives me a description or instructions for each field.

- [x] **User Story #12**: Inside the form element, I can select an option from a dropdown that has a corresponding id="dropdown".

- [x] **User Story #13**: Inside the form element, I can select a field from one or more groups of radio buttons. Each group should be grouped using the name attribute.

- [x] **User Story #14**: Inside the form element, I can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute.

- [x] **User Story #15**: Inside the form element, I am presented with a textarea at the end for additional comments.

- [x] **User Story #16**: Inside the form element, I am presented with a button with id="submit" to submit all my inputs.
