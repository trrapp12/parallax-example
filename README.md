This is a simple project that I did to try and experiment with something that fascinated me--using parallax to create the appearance of interaction in a three dimensional environment (think x, y, z axis). 

I used the parallax.js library from [Matthew Wagerfield](http://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/) for the javascript. With the help of the library it wasn't very hard to do.  

###What did I do?  

* identified something I didn't know and found a way to learn it
* wireframed the project in Photoshop
* created a custom logo in Photoshop
* created 5 other .png files as graphics
* created the custom CSS in CSS# o work with javascript files
* created the HTML in HTML5
* 
All the graphics are my own and were created in Photoshop.
