# parallax-example

#####Trevor Rapp


This is a simple project that I did to try and experiment with something that fascinated me--using parallax to create 
the appearance of interaction in a three dimensional environment (think x, y, z axis).  

I built it from scratch.  The graphics were created by me in Adobe Photoshop.  I did consult tutorials, but I don't 
consider that to take very much from the hard work that I accomplished.

I hope you enjoy.
