<sub>*This is a simple project that I did to try and experiment with something that fascinated me--using parallax to create the appearance of interaction in a three dimensional environment (think x, y, z axis).*</sub>

### Description:
---

The parallax effect assigns x, y, and z values to separate graphic elements and then calculates actions and movement in response to the movement of the mouse or to the tilt of the tablet if you are on a tablet or phone with an accelerometer.  

I used the parallax.js library from [Matthew Wagerfield](http://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/) for the javascript. Therefore I cannot take credit for the logic that controls the motion.  

### Project demonstrates the following:
---

- [x] Ability to teach myself interests outside of formal instruction.
- [x] Integration of Photoshop layers and images in wireframing.
- [x] Create a custom logo in Photoshop.
- [x] Created the custom CSS using CSS3.
- [x] Integration of JavaScript libraries.
- [x] Use of HTML5.
- [x] Accomplish a goal I didn't think I'd be able to do when I began the course.
- [x] All art assets created by myself in Photoshop.
